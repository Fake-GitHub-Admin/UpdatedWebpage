# First-Personal-Website
My first personal Webpage, take a look at all the html code, see what you like and be sure to leave your thoughts on the webpage.
Thanks for your time.

C++ as well as Java Script additions to the webpage are yet to come so stay tuned (star it too if you want to keep track of the progress).

Also the file order is
1. Server Invitation 
2. Terms and Rules
3. Events
4. Chill and Hangout
5. Tables (Work in Progress)

3/21 Edit: I added in an mp4 just for those with no access to a text editor app. (Many more updates to come).
